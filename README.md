Create back-end with node.js and express

   in the backend folder run:
   `npm install express cors mongoose dotenv`
   install globally
   `npm install -g nodemon `
   Npm Dependencies:
1. Express - is helping up make the web server
1. Cors - stands for cross-origin resource sharing and allows AJAX requests to skip the same origin pulse so you can access resources form remote hosts. It comes with express middleware that can enable cross-origin resource sharing with different options. It makes it so that we can make the right connections on our network that we need to make.
1. Mongoose- allows up to interact with our MongoDb database
1. Dotenv - loads environmental variables from a .env file with process.env
1. nodemon - makes development easier, helps development with node.js applications by automatically restarting the application wehen file changes in the directory are detected. So we don't have to restart our server every time we make an update to our files.

`npm install axios @material-ui/core @material-ui/lab @material-ui/icons`

dao directory - stands for data access object
